This repository contains my work for the [Computer Vision Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891) offered by Udacity. Three projects are included:

- project 1: [Facial Key Point detection using a CNN](project1_facial_key_points_detection).

- project 2: [Image Captioning using a CNN encoder and a RNN decoder](project2_image_captioning).

- project 3: [Simultaneous Localization and Mapping](project3_slam).
